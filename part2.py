'''
A csv file is a file representing a table where each line is a row, and columns are separated by commas.
For example, 

Max,34,Male
Timmy,7,Male

Write a program that reads data.csv (also in this directory) and writes only the second column to a file, each number on its own line. 
You may need the split function: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp
